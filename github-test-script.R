#GitHub Test R Script
#################################################################################

# After creating a new branch off of the main branch, or after forking to your own GitHub account if you don't have write privileges to this repository,
#   edit this program in any way you like.
# After you edit, you'll need to commit the file with the new changes and then open a pull request;
#      You can open a Pull Request at any point during the development process: when you have little or no code but want to share some screenshots or general ideas,
#      when you're stuck and need help or advice, or when you're ready for someone to review your work.
# By using GitHub's @mention system in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams
